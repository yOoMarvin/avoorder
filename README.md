## Setup
Check that you have [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed on your machine and run ``pod install``
This will install the necessary pods that are used to communicate with the Firestore by Firebase

You'll also need the newest xCode version to use SwiftUI. 
Let me tell you something. It is amazing...
